# 📗 My Note 

This is a simple note-taking app inspired by Notion.\
It has a simple and intuitive easy-to-use UI.\
A User can create/edit/delete notes.

## ✏️ Features

- **Slash Commands** (Type '/' to turn the block into different types of text)
- **Anonymous Authentication** (Anyone can read/create notes but can only edit/delete their own notes )
- **Dark Theme** (Support dark theme for a user's personal preference)

---

## 📚 Tech Stack

- **React** (UI Components)
- **CSS Modules** (Styling)
- **Firebase** (Logic and Database)

The tech stack of the app is rather simple because I wanted to focus my attention on consolidating what I'd learned before and try fitting them all together.\
So I didn't use any external libraries/packages that could have made the app richer, but I was still able to learn and review a lot of things by building it😊
